# Card Component

The `Card` component is the backbone of this library. Most components use `Card` as a container to achieve the signature glass-like appearance that defines the library's style.

## Shared Props

Almost every component in this library inherit the same props as the `Card` component. This ensures consistency and flexibility when customizing components.

## Customization

The `Card` component can be customized in various ways to suit your design needs:

- **No Padding**: Enable or disable the default padding using the `noPadding` prop. By default, the padding effect is enabled with a value of `2 rem`.
- **No Blur**: Enable or disable the glass-like blur effect using the `noBlur` prop. By default, the blur effect is enabled.
- **Appereance**: Define the appereance of the card using the `appereance` prop. The options are: `ghost`, `mate` and `outlined`. If **appearance** prop is not defined, it will use the default appereance of card.
- **Color**: Define the primary color of the card using the `color` prop. For example, `color="blue"`.
- **Intensity**: Adjust the intensity of the color using the `intensity` prop. Higher values create a more vivid appearance.

These customization options allow you to create a wide range of styles, from subtle to bold, while maintaining the library's cohesive design language.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Card } from 'azeriand-library';

<Card appearance="ghost" color="blue" intensity={500}>
  Your content here
</Card>
```

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Card} />

## Examples


### Default Card

This is the default configuration of the `Card` component. It demonstrates the basic appearance and functionality without any additional props.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />


### No Padding

By using the `noPadding` prop, you can remove the default padding from the `Card` component. This is useful when you want to have full control over the content's spacing.

<Canvas of={CardStories.NoPadding} />



### No Blur

By using the `noBlur` prop, you can remove the default blur from the `Card` component.
<Canvas of={CardStories.NoBlur} />

### Appearance

The `Card` component can achieve different types of appearance by setting the `appearance` prop to `ghost`, `mate` or `outlined`.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Appearance} />


### Custom Colors and Intensity

You can use any combination of color and intensity while using cards.

<Canvas of={CardStories.ColorAndIntensity} />


### Custom Styles

You can apply custom styles to the `Card` component using the `style` prop or using Tailwind classnames. This allows you to override the default styles and add your own.
